**How much water should we really drink for good skin?**

Give your skin a dewy look just by drinking at least 2.5 liters of filtered water per day. Preferably it should be alkaline water (9. 5 pH); add lemon to automatically alkaline. It sounds like a lot, but it will do the trick! This can also prevent and eliminate blackheads and improve dry skin.



**Benefits of Green Tea**

Drink at least 3 cups of green tea daily to keep your skin glowing. It is loaded with antioxidants and nutrients which lower the risk of many diseases. It boosts the metabolism making your body function properly. The catechins in green tea can kill bacteria making the skin look healthier.



**Sun screen - a must have for skin **

Screen your sunscreen! Even if the weather is overcast, cold or pouring with rain do not forget to use the sunscreen. Use a moisturizer which contains an SPF as an easy way of wearing it. Years of exposure to ultraviolet rays can build up and lead to premature aging.
