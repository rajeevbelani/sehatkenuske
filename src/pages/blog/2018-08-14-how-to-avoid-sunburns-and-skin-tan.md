1. Avoid being outdoors between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., when the UV rays are more intense.

2. If you have to be outside during these hours, try to wear a wide rimmed hat/ cap, sunglasses that protect your eyes from UV rays, and clothing made of light coloured, light weight, tightly woven material.

3. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. Apply to the skin whenever you go outside or ride in the car. Repeat the application after every 3-4 hours, especially if you are swimming or perspiring

4. Drink plenty of fluids to keep your body hydrated, and to replace the loss by sunburn. Drink at least two glasses of water before going in the sun.

5. Eat lots of lean and high quality protein foods. Also include raw fruits to supply the vitamins and minerals needed.

6. Wear clothes which are loose fitting and are capable of absorbing sweat. Prefer clothes that cover the whole body.

7. And in case you do get sunburns or tan, always consult a qualified Dermatologist. 

Lastly don't forget to ENJOY THE SUMMERS :)
